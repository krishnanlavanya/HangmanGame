## About the project

Hangman is a classic word guessing game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for generations. It's a word puzzle where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

Objective
The primary objective of the Hangman game is to guess the hidden word or phrase correctly before running out of attempts. This game is not only fun but also helps improve vocabulary and word-solving skills.

The game is responsive to different window sizes, built with HTML, CSS3, and vanilla javascript.

## Project files description

- **index.html** - The project's enterypoint.
- **main.js** - The main javascript file that's responsible for running the game's logic, the animations, as well as fetching data from the APIs used in the project.
- **rope.js** - This JS file contains the code for all canvas animations used to calculate and display the hanging animation of the person. The file mainly contains the logic that simulates the motion of a rope, which is the implementation of simple particle system that uses the physics of a spring force applied to each two connected particles to simulate the tension a real rope. The spring force  is calculated using **Hooke's Law** with a spring-damper system which is modeled as follows:  **<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math MathML">
  <mi>F</mi>
  <mo>=</mo>
  <mo>&#x2212;</mo>
  <mi>&#x3B2;</mi>
  <mi>v</mi>
  <mo>&#x2212;</mo>
  <mi>k</mi>
  <mi>x</mi>
</math>**. Where:
    * **x** is the vector displacement of the end of the spring from itâ€™s equilibrium position.
    * **k** is  a constant describing the tightness of the spring.
    * **b** is the coefficient of damping.
    * **v** is the relative velocity between the two points connected by the spring.

    You can tweek all these parameters which are declared in the beginning of this file along with other paramters such as the **mass** of the particle, the **density** of each rope, and the **gravity** of the system to get different rope animation results.
- **loader.js** - This JS file is responsible for displaying a loading animation while preloading all the media assets of the project (images and sounds) using [PreloadJS](https://createjs.com/preloadjs).
